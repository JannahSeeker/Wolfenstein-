Sure! Let‚Äôs go line-by-line through the runMyFPS.m file so you understand everything it‚Äôs doing. This is a headless launcher for your game that runs three loops‚Äîinput, logic, and render‚Äîin parallel threads using parfeval.

‚∏ª

üìÑ File: runMyFPS.m

function runMyFPS()

	‚Ä¢	This declares a function named runMyFPS.
	‚Ä¢	It takes no inputs, and it‚Äôs the entry point for launching your game engine in the background.

‚∏ª



%RUNMYFPS  Head‚Äëless launcher that runs each loop on its own background
%          worker (parfeval) and prints minimal status to the console.
%
%   Stops when the user presses ENTER or when gameState.running == false.

	‚Ä¢	This is the function documentation comment (MATLAB shows this when you type help runMyFPS).
	‚Ä¢	It explains the function launches the game in background threads and stops when ENTER is pressed or a flag turns false.

‚∏ª



%% 1) Build all state
gs = initGameState();

	‚Ä¢	Initializes the game state by calling initGameState().
	‚Ä¢	gs is likely a struct containing global game variables like player, map, etc.

‚∏ª



%% 2) Ensure a parallel pool (threads profile)
pool = gcp("nocreate");
if isempty(pool)
    pool = parpool("threads");   %#ok<NASGU>
end

	‚Ä¢	gcp("nocreate") gets the current parallel pool without creating a new one.
	‚Ä¢	If none exists, it creates one using the ‚Äúthreads‚Äù profile, which runs things in background threads.
	‚Ä¢	#ok<NASGU> is a hint to MATLAB not to warn about pool being unused.

‚∏ª



%% 3) Launch background tasks
fInput  = parfeval(@inputLoop,  0, gs);   % 0 outputs
fLogic  = parfeval(@logicLoop,  0, gs);
fRender = parfeval(@renderLoop, 0, gs);   % renderLoop can discard frames

	‚Ä¢	parfeval(func, nOut, input1, ...) runs func in the background.
	‚Ä¢	Each function (inputLoop, logicLoop, renderLoop) runs in its own thread.
	‚Ä¢	0 means no return values are expected.
	‚Ä¢	Each one gets access to the shared game state gs.

‚∏ª



fprintf("Game running in background threads ‚Äì press ENTER to stop...\n");

	‚Ä¢	Prints a message to the console so the user knows the game is running.

‚∏ª



%% 4) Wait for user interrupt or gameState.running flag
stopRequested = false;
h = listener(gs,'running','PostSet',@(~,~)checkStop()); %#ok<LNVEN>

	‚Ä¢	Creates a flag stopRequested to track if we should shut down.
	‚Ä¢	Sets up a listener on the gs.running property so if it‚Äôs ever changed (set to false), checkStop() is called.

‚∏ª



% Non‚Äëblocking keyboard wait
try
    pause on
    while ~stopRequested && gs.running
        pause(0.2);
        if ~isempty(get(groot,'CurrentCharacter')) || ~isempty(get(groot,'CurrentKey'))
            stopRequested = true;
        end
    end
catch
    % If the user closed MATLAB command window
end

	‚Ä¢	This is a loop that checks every 0.2 seconds for two things:
	1.	Whether stopRequested is true.
	2.	Whether gs.running is still true.
	‚Ä¢	It also checks if a key was pressed using groot (the graphics root).
	‚Ä¢	If the command window is closed (causing an error), it‚Äôs caught silently.

‚∏ª



%% 5) Clean shutdown
cancel([fInput, fLogic, fRender]);
delete(h);

	‚Ä¢	Cancels all background threads.
	‚Ä¢	Deletes the property listener on gs.running.

‚∏ª



fprintf("Shutdown complete.\n");

	‚Ä¢	Confirms that everything was shut down properly.

‚∏ª



% ----------------------------------------------------------
function checkStop()
    % If some part of the game sets gs.running = false, exit
    if ~gs.running
        stopRequested = true;
    end
end

	‚Ä¢	This is the callback function for the listener.
	‚Ä¢	If some game logic changes gs.running to false, this sets stopRequested = true, triggering the shutdown.

‚∏ª

üîÅ Summary Flow:
	1.	Initializes game state.
	2.	Starts parallel pool.
	3.	Starts input, logic, and render loops in background.
	4.	Waits for a key press or gs.running to turn false.
	5.	Cancels all loops and shuts down gracefully.
